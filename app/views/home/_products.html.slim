          b Vox 360 reinvents the world of guided tours by combining two separate audio systems into one compact device:
        p
          ul
            li Vox Card Radio 99C: Tour guides use a wireless microphone system while group-members listen to the explanation using earphones. Tours can be enjoyed without disturbance from ambient noise, and wireless reception means more personal space for the group-members.
            br
            li Vox Optical Audioguide: The optical audioguide is a device that contains pre-recorded audio-tracks. This system lets individual tourists visit museums, sites and other attractions on their own time. When pointed to a specific image on the included map it will automatically begin to play the corresponding audio-track.

        p The Vox Optical Audioguide can be configured for any tourist site or city, and it gives the opportunity to plan a simple but intuitive visit.
        p
          b Vox 360 it's the perfect device for tour programs that offer guided tours in some cities, and free time to explore in others.
